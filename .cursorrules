# Project Rules

## UI Components

- **ONLY use shadcn/ui components** for every UI element in the application
- Do not create custom UI components from scratch
- Do not use other UI libraries (Material-UI, Ant Design, Chakra UI, etc.)
- If a UI element is needed, check if shadcn/ui has a component for it first
- If shadcn/ui doesn't have the exact component, use the closest shadcn/ui component and extend/customize it rather than creating a new one from scratch

## Component Standards

- Always install shadcn/ui components using the official CLI when adding new components
- Follow shadcn/ui component patterns and structure
- Use the CSS variables from the theme (defined in globals.css) for styling
- Maintain consistency with shadcn/ui design patterns

## Theme

- Use the shadcn/ui blue theme that's configured in globals.css
- All colors should use CSS variables (--primary, --background, etc.)
- Support both light and dark modes using the .dark class
